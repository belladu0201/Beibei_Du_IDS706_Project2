2042 I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
2043 Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
2044 At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
2045 And with that in my blood I was born to be different
2046 Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
2047 But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
2048 Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
2049 Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
2050 But I know they dont want me in the damn club
2051 They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
2052 I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
2053 Swear Ive been baptized least or times

2057 Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
2058 So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
2059 And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
2060 And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
2061 You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
2062 But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye

2087 And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
2088 Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
2089 Carline told me I could buy two tickets
2090 I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
2091 And kept little brother at bay at a distance
2092 But everything that I felt was more bogus
2093 Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
2094 Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
2095 I guess Ill understand when I get more older
2096 Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
2097 Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
2098 Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
2099 Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
2100 The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
2101 I was always on the other side of the peephole
2102 Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
2103 And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
2104 But to be number one Imma beat my brother
2105 On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
2106 Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
2107 Sibling rivalry only I could see
2108 It was the pride in me that was drivin me
2109 At the Grammys I said I inspired me
2110 But my big brother who I always tried to be
2111 When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
2112 Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
2113 I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
2114 But my shit was more like a finger roll
2115 But I had them singles though
2116 And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
2117 I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
2118 Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
2119 Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
2120 Translate espanol No way Jose
2121 Then I went and told Jay Brown
2122 Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
2123 Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
2124 But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
2125 And Ill never let my son have an ego
2126 Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
2127 I mean I might even make him be Republican
2128 So everybody know he love white people
2129 And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
2130 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
2131 And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
2132 I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
2133 See I just want him to have an easy life
2134 Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
2135 Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
2136 Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
2137 And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
2138 I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
2139 And Ill never let his mom move to LA
2140 Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
2141 I think I just fell in love with a porn star
2142 Turn the camera on she a born star
2143 Turn the corners in a foreign car
2144 Call the coroners do the CPR
2145 She gave that old nigga a ulcer

3666 And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
3667 You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
3668 Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
3669 When you first stop caring about your appearance

3671 Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
3672 My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
3673 Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
3674 Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
3675 I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
3676 But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
3677 I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
3678 And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
3679 Twenty years later where has the time gone
3680 Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
3681 Now that Im grown the tables turned around
3682 I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
3683 He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
3684 Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
3685 But he be like D Bo round his mama there
3686 Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again

3688 I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
3689 You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms

3693 Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
3694 Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
3695 There must be more good women than men percentage wise
3696 So her chance of having a husband just minimized
3697 Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
3698 And mess with other girls part time to improvise
3699 I knew she wasnt bi
3700 No I seen it in her eyes
3701 But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
3702 She telling me about how black people should enterprise
3703 And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
3704 That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
3705 With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
3706 Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie

3708 She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
3709 And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
3710 Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
3711 Boo back in I was just like you

3715 And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
3716 Was it something I did wrong
3717 Yeah I know Im wrong
3718 Shes at home alone and Im always gone
3719 Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
3720 Now she on the internet looking for classes
3721 Out of state though man that hurt yo
3722 But I got work though and Im at work yo
3723 And she dont call a lot

3736 Her mother picked up the phone
3737 Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
3738 I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
3739 So her chance of having a husband just minimize
3740 I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
3741 And focus on school fulltime to improvise
3742 Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
3743 And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
3744 First day of school Imma take you sight seein
